## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- OpenModelica (omc)
- Git

### Setting up Development Environment

1. Clone your fork:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/fz-modelica.git
   cd fz-modelica
   ```

2. Install fz framework:
   ```bash
   pip install funz-fz
   # or for development:
   pip install -e git+https://github.com/Funz/fz.git
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```

## Testing

Before submitting a pull request:

1. Test with the provided examples:
   ```bash
   cd examples
   python run_single.py
   python run_parametric.py
   python run_with_cache.py
   ```

2. Test with your own Modelica models if applicable

3. Ensure the calculator script works correctly:
   ```bash
   cd samples
   bash ../.fz/calculators/Modelica.sh NewtonCooling.mo
   # Should generate output files
   ```
